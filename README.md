# PromptDrivenReactModal

This is a learning project focusing on **prompt engineering** using **ChatGPT**. The primary aim is to become adept at crafting, refining, and optimizing prompts to achieve tailored and specific outputs.

## Objective

The objective of this project was to refine an initial, general prompt into a more detailed and specific one that would yield a more accurate and tailored output, specifically for creating a React modal component.

## Prompts and Responses

### Prompt 1:
"I'm going to give you a prompt, and I want you to help me optimize it. Ask me clarifying questions, then suggest a more effective prompt that will yield a more accurate and detailed output. Here's the prompt: "Show me a code snippet for a modal in React."

#### chatGPT's Answer:
Certainly! Let's start with some clarifying questions to ensure we tailor the prompt for your specific needs:

1. **Type of Modal**: Are you interested in a basic modal (with just text), or should it have interactive elements, such as buttons, form fields, etc.?
2. **Styling**: Do you have a specific design or style in mind, or are you okay with a basic design? Would you like this to use CSS-in-JS, an external stylesheet, or a specific library like styled-components?
3. **State Management**: How would you prefer to handle the state of the modal? Would you like it to be handled with local component state (using `useState`) or with a state management tool like Redux or Context API?
4. **Animation**: Do you want any specific opening/closing animations or transitions?
5. **Accessibility**: Are there any specific accessibility features or best practices you would like implemented (e.g., focus trapping, keyboard navigation)?
6. **Dependencies**: Are you okay with using external libraries for this, or do you prefer a solution with no external dependencies?

Once I have more details, I can create a more tailored prompt for you!

### Prompt 2:
1. Only text is required for now.
2. Use an external CSS stylesheet with a modern design.
3. Implement local component state.
4. Incorporate a simple fade in/out effect.
5. Adhere to American accessibility standards.
6. Do not use external libraries.

#### chatGPT's Answer:
Got it! Based on your clarifications, here's a more optimized prompt:

"Provide a React code snippet for a modal that:

1. Displays only text content.
2. Uses an external CSS stylesheet for modern design styling.
3. Manages its open and closed state using local component state via `useState`.
4. Features a simple fade in and fade out animation upon opening and closing.
5. Adheres to American accessibility standards, ensuring keyboard navigation and focus management.
6. Does not incorporate external libraries."

This prompt is more specific and should yield a more accurate and detailed output tailored to your needs. Would you like the solution now based on this prompt?

### Prompt 3:
Yes
